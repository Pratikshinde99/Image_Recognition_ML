# ðŸš€ Image Recognition - 5 Days Bootcamp

## ðŸ“Œ About This Project
**Image Recognition 5 Days Bootcamp** is a hands-on, project-based journey into modern computer vision.  
Built and tested entirely in **Google Colab**, this bootcamp covers the full pipeline from **data preparation to model evaluation**.

---

## ðŸ“… Bootcamp Roadmap
- **Day 1**: Dataset download, MNIST & CIFAR-10 exploration, preprocessing, and visualization  
- **Day 2**: Building and training a CNN from scratch (TensorFlow/Keras)  
- **Day 3**: Data augmentation, batch normalization, and advanced model training  
- **Day 4**: Transfer learning with MobileNetV2 on Cats vs. Dogs dataset (Kaggle)  
- **Day 5 (Suggested)**: Model evaluation (ROC/AUC), confusion matrix, deployment tips  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Project?
- **End-to-End Workflow**: From data prep to model evaluation, simulating a real-world ML pipeline  
- **Industry-Ready Practices**: Transfer learning, augmentation, batch normalization, and ROC/AUC evaluation  
- **Portfolio Showcase**: Fully annotated notebook cells for clarity and reproducibility  
- **Recruiter Value**: Demonstrates proficiency with TensorFlow, Keras, Kaggle, Colab, and GitHub
